# Step 1: Use an official Node.js image as a base
FROM node:18 AS builder

# Step 2: Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Step 3: Copy package.json and package-lock.json first (to leverage caching)
COPY package.json ./

# Step 4: Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Step 5: Copy the rest of the project
COPY . .

# Step 6: Build the Next.js app
RUN npm run build

# Step 7: Use a smaller image for production (to reduce the image size)
FROM node:18-slim

# Step 8: Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Step 9: Copy only the built files from the builder stage
COPY --from=builder /app/.next /app/.next
COPY --from=builder /app/package.json /app/package.json
COPY --from=builder /app/public /app/public

# Step 10: Install only production dependencies
RUN npm install --production

# Step 11: Expose the port your app will run on
EXPOSE 3000

# Step 12: Start the application
CMD ["npm", "start"]
